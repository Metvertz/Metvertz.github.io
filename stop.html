      The Statistical Transparency of Policing (STOP) Program's fourth annual report investigates officer-initiated traffic and pedestrian stops in Oregon, focusing on potential racial disparities in law enforcement interactions. The study includes data from 148 law enforcement agencies and uses three statistical tests to examine potential racial disparities in stops, stop outcomes, and search findings.

The Oregon Legislature mandated the collection of traffic and pedestrian stop data in 2017, with the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission (CJC) responsible for analyzing the data to identify potential racial disparities. The STOP Program aims to ensure accurate data collection, minimize the impact on law enforcement agencies, and maintain officer safety during the data collection process.

The STOP Program addresses concerns with traditional analyses by using three statistical tests: Decision to Stop Analysis, Stop Outcomes Analysis, and Search Findings Analysis. The Decision to Stop Analysis uses variations in daylight to examine the initial decision to stop an individual, comparing stop rates for minority individuals to those for white individuals. The Stop Outcomes Analysis employs propensity score analysis to explore disparities in stop outcomes, matching stop data between two groups based on all available characteristics, with race/ethnicity as the only variable. The Search Findings Analysis compares search success rates across racial/ethnic groups to identify potential disparities.

the STOP Program's annual report attempts to highlight the importance of understanding racial disparities in law enforcement interactions and using robust methodologies to examine these disparities. By employing multiple statistical tests, the STOP Program aims to provide a more accurate understanding of the impact of race/ethnicity on law enforcement interactions in Oregon. 

One glaring oversight that I thought about throughout the entirety of the paper, was that one of the primary metric in identifying racial disparity and prejudice in policing was the ratio of individuals of different ethnicities pulled over in the daylight. This completely and utterly fails to account for over-policing in heavily diverse areas, where the probability of any given driver getting pulled over is weighted heavily to be a BIPOC driver. 

While itâ€™s still apparent in the evidence that the amount of driver pulled over are disproportionate to the expected value; the oversight mentioned in the previous paragraph leads me to the conclusion that the difference and disparity is actually much more severe than reported.
