        The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas is a story that calls into question the morals and ethics of a utilitarian society. 
        It specifically shows that even in the most perfect of communities relying on the suffering of others to function, even people reaping the rewards of a said society can and will ‘walk away.’
      </strong>
      The author uses every fanciful description of a city filled with joy, using expressive language like “clamor of bells,” “shimmering of gong and tambourine,” and “a cheerful faint sweetness of the air” when initially describing the city. 
      Descriptions similar in theme to these continue until the author describes a basement in the town where a poor, malnourished, and abused child lives. 
      The entire city is aware of this child and understands that their joy depends on this child's suffering. 
      Omelas is a giant analogy for a utilitarian society, where right and wrong are considered not from individual actions but by the collective outcome of the actions. 
      In no isolated context can you claim what’s occurring to the child is by any means ethically moral. 
      It is the most heinous and evil thing the author could likely conjure for this fake city. 
      In the context utilitarian mindset, however, while the child's treatment is still wrong, the outcome of their misery (i.e., the prosperity of the society) is a net good outcome, justifying the basement child's treatment. 
      The beauty of the story lies in its title and main theme, ‘The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas.’ 
      Despite living in a perfect society for all but the basement child, many citizens of Omelas still chose to leave the city, knowing the dark truth behind what fuels the city. 
      Walking away is a direct analogy for people who understand a utilitarian society's benefits while refusing to participate. 
      Those that recognize that the society they find themselves in can only function due to the suffering and misery of others might decide to remove themselves as much as possible. 
      This isn’t as easy as it is in the Omelas, as there are fully encompassing aspects of society that are rooted in the abuse of others in nearly every aspect. 
      But still, various small changes and movements can reduce the amount that a given individual interacts with the system. 
      Still, the statement that people would walk away from Omelas is the main focus, detailing through an analogy that a utilitarian mindset is deeply flawed.
