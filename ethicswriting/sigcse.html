        Throughout the discussion of her paper, the author makes clear that the SIGCSE review and paneling process is heavily biased and absurdly elitist.
      </strong>
 This is made clear through her breakdown of several problematic review points. The first section detailing relevance and interest showed clear bias against the abstract, using thinly veiled and contradictory information about the abstract to try and rip it apart.

This feels like another example of bringing up completely unrelated or distracting critiques when the real reasoning lies with either the abstract, the author, the panelists, their identities, or something else along those lines. The next section reveals as much; the entirety of the panelist consideration was really hard to read, consisting only of ripping apart the status of individuals to deduce how technically sound they’d be.

Much of the comments on grammar felt contrived and very nitpicky, as well as blatantly inaccurate. Finally the references section was one of the most telling portions, describing issues that we’re quite literally outside of the scope of the project in its entirety.
The full breakdown of the situation details just how highly flawed the SIGCSE review panelists are. Academic pursuits often bring out elitism which inevitably comes with racial and gender biases in close tow. But the reviews on this given board scream out extreme elitism which tells a story in itself: that even scientific boards and pursuits that are designed with specific interest groups in mind still manage to find themselves apart of the elitist academic umbrella. Academia might carry a heavy amount of elitism potentially because of the work required to reach levels
