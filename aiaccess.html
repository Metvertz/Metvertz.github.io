Artificial intelligence is changing the way we live and work, from recommending ads to predicting market trends and discovering astronomical anomalies. It has become an increasingly important part of the modern world. This is most obvious in the professional and industry sectors, changing the way these fields work. This has also created new opportunities for the neurodivergent community. <strong> AI-powered tools are providing accessibility to neurodivergent individuals in education and job opportunities, and this trend is likely to continue in the future, paving the way for a more inclusive society. </strong>
Neurodivergence describes the natural variability in how people's brains are wired. Conditions like autism and ADHD, encompassed in neurodivergence, often manifest in childhood but frequently go undiagnosed or poorly treated, making it difficult for neurodivergent children to keep up with their neurotypical peers in school and adjust to their environment. AI is however leveling the playing field, making it easier for people who are neurodivergent to participate in the classroom and access tools that didn’t previously exist. One example mentioned in the article is InnerVoice by iTherapy is an app that utilizes AI to help users better form connections between objects and language. This all shows how tools powered by artificial intelligence are slowly making things more accessible for people that previously had significant disadvantages over their more privileged peers in education.
Much of the early article talks about this change for early education. The second half talks about how AI is helpful for those already in the workplace, and while I found a similar theme as above in that section, I found an additional theme that occurred. I felt that the second half of the article tokenized neurodivergent individuals boxing them into certain areas that they were declared to excel at. I think the article made many good points about how AI could help those individuals but simultaneously did a very weird tokenization of neurodivergent people. I felt quite uncomfortable with the description of how neurodivergent people deserved to be hired because they were better at these highly specialized tasks, and not just because they’re people that deserve equal treatment. This feels like an entire diverge from the earlier article.
