      Being informed, being outspoken, and supporting the movement
      There's a multitude of different ways that a student at WU broadly or specifically at the comittee of studies can help change the landscape for the better.
      The most important thing and relevant infromation from the end of the video we watched is to be informed. You can't jump into any cause without first fully understanding much of what the cause is actually about. This means, especially in areas of racial conflict, division, or inequality understanding the group in question and the problems that have occured. It's not enough to just acknowledge the existence of a problem but instead to further take steps to understand every aspect of the problem. This includes the surface level knowledge of just the setting and what's occured from it. But this also includes the issues that led to this problem in the first part and often how systematic corruption runs deep.
      It's also not just enough for yourself to be informed and stop there, being apart of those that educate others is also a very important task. This means that you have to understand your own ability to be involved with the movement and actively help that movement progress in a positive direction. A paper entitled Social Movemenets and the Education of Desires lists out (among other things) good stratagies of how to educate your peers in a helpful and construive way to further any social movements you're involved with. No one wants to be yelled at or harassed for the sake of education behind a topic and negatively responding to someone is never a good stratagy to get people to see eye to eye with your movement. Instead educating in a positive and paitent way, even when that doesn't seem like the quickest or most efficent route will lead to the most results. 
      This nicely leads into the section about being outspoken, in order for any movement to further grow and seek change it requires a littany of people to speak out against problems that are plaguing their soceity. These problems need to be spoken about and made wide knowledge of but actionable plans also need to spoken up and out about. It's one thing to just complain about the state of soceity, we all do that on a daily basis about many issues we come across and it's often just a basic human need to do that. But in order for a movement to take off and actually suceed it can't just be mindless complaining, and instead needs actionable steps that will make some kind of positive change, big or small against the problem being discussed. This is often a hard part for any individual as it's rare when someone has a concretely good idea of what to do and how to proceed.
      This leads to the final part of figuring out a bigger movement to support and doing what you can for the cause. Often times larger and bigger causes will have significant movements behind them with very clearly laid out actionplans that have steps that can actually be taken both to help the movement and to work to positive change. No movement is just built on a singluar person but instead are often the collective force of dozen, hundreds, if not thousands and thousands of individuals trying to make change at some scale, either in their local communities or in their broader wider communities. 
      So with this all said, what can I, a single WUCOS student do to make a positive difference in everything? I would say the first step is to find something you're very passionate and deeply interested in. There's so very much wrong with the world and because of that, it's not possible to be involved with every single movement- you'll get burntout and ineffectual at anything if you try that. But if you find a specific issue, such as racial inequality, then you can look into movements that heavily focus on and specialize in dealing with that topic and from that point can move further. From that point be open and outspoken about that topic and continue to do good however you cam
